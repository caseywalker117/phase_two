'''
Phase 2 berry project
- Detect the PCB outline.
    ~ Find the corners of the outer outline.
    ~ Draw straight lines using the points to get cleans edges.
    ~

- Find all markers and replace them with sensor models.
    ~ Replace tags with a model of the sensor in a preview
    ~ Draw symbol on the PCB layout for the specific sensor

- Draw paths to connect all sensors in a chain.
    ~ Get the orientation from the marker.
    ~ Know where the contacts need to be placed
    ~ Rout the path using XML, not intersecting with the sensors or the perimeter.

- Export as a finished CAD file for making a pcb.
    ~ Finished file should be something usable. (dwg or something similar)
    ~ Export the file with the models of the sensors on the pcb.
